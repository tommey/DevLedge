Welcome!

This project is a collection of sample programs, solutions for IT problems.

There will be code snippets for teaching/learning and a lot more stuff will be solutions for problems that I came through while creating websites, setting up systems/servers, developing desktop applications and testing new technologies in practice.

If you have any helpful ideas, codes or anything else, just let me know. :)
