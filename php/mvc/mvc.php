/**
 * Modelâ€“viewâ€“controller (MVC) is a software architecture pattern which 
 * separates the representation of information from the user's interaction 
 * with it. 
 * 
 * @see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modelâ€“viewâ€“controller
 *
 * The concept:
 * - The client request is routed to a Controller's action.
 * - The Controller modifies the Model and/or gets data from it for the View.
 * - The Model modifies and queries resources with business logic.
 * - The View gets data to be displayed for the client, it generates response.
 * 
 * This file routes the request to the Controller's appropriate action.
 * 
 * Comments:
 * - You should always have a class loader, which knows where to search
 *   for your custom classes by name or namespace, but this part does
 *   not deal with this feature, just assumes it exists and works.
