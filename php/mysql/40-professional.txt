It's the same as the OO way, but the DB class contains many-many more features:

    Features
        Separate functions for SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE queries to handle 
		the different DB answers 
    Optimization
        Caching queries and results 
    Security
        Binding - SQL injection prevention
        Escaping data - to handle evil input 

Also in main database handlers you can find an individual class for resultset 
handling and much more classes for specific purposes.

I have to note that mysql_* functions are the very old way, if you wish to 
create your own class set for database handling then you should use MySQLi 
class or functions! See: http://www.php.net/manual/en/class.mysqli.php
